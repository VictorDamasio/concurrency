# CONCURRENCY

This C++ code is intended to benchmark some sorting algorithms using concurrency. Choosing 4 algorithms at a time, the code spawns 4 threads and runs several tests varying the input (array) size, and then we can compare the time it takes for each of them to complete.
Part of a data structures project.
